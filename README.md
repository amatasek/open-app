Confluence: [30 Day Growth Challenge](https://artisantechgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AI/pages/1108475905/30+Day+Growth+Challenge)

## Overall Plan/Goal
Days 1-14: React Native
Days 15-30: Azure Blueprints

Goal: Build a complete template application using React Native and Azure Blueprints to be used as a foundation for making new applications.


## Daily Log

### 1/1

1. Read through the challenge description and came up with a loose plan:
		- Days 1-14: Learn about the basics of Reactive Native and build a tiny demo app.
		- Days: 15-30: Learn about Azure Blueprints and demo the React Native app using a blueprint.
2. Created a Pluralsight channel and added 3 React Native courses to start.

### 1/2

1. Completed modules 1 & 2 of "React Native: The Big Picture" course on Pluralsight.

### 1/3

1. Completed module 3 of "React Native: The Big Picture" course on Pluralsight. Thoughts so far:
	* Very basic, high level overview of Reactive Native.
	* Better suited for a sales person or product stakeholder evaluating frameworks.
	* Learned about the overall philosophy of the framework.
	* Love the mobile first, but also a web-app mindset.
	* Impressed with the promises, seems like an almost perfect choice for a modern application.
	* 2.5 Stars
2. Tools/links that may be useful:
	* React Native Debugger
	* Microsoft CodePush (App Center)
	* [Official Blog](https://reactnative.dev/blog)
	* [Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
	* [Source Code](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

### 1/4
1. Completed the course "React Native: The Big Picture".
2. To Start:
	* npm install -g expo-cli
	* expo init MyNewProject
	* cd MyNewProject npm start
3. Alternative: [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)

### 1/5
1. Installed node/npm
2. Installed expo
3. Initialized a brand new React Native app using ignite and explored the template!

### 1/6
1. Started course "React Native: Getting Started"
2. Used the app I spun up earlier to compare with the basic app shown in the course and compared the simple/advanced styles.
3. Started gutting the template into something truly basic.

### 1/8
1. Continued course and experimented with running and debugging the app

### 1/10
1. Continued course and added basic navigation to the app!

### 1/11
1. Deviated from the plan tonight when I wondered about making a custom hardware monitoring dashboard inside the app. Spent way to much time learning about hardware statistic servers and their apis. Installed one and began configuring it.

### 1/13
1. Returned to my Pluralsight course "React Native: Getting Started" and completed a few more sections.

### 1/15
1. Enjoyed the next few sections in bed :)

### 1/16
1. learned about navigation and deep linking in react native.

### 1/17
1. Learned about text inputs and building forms in react native. 
2. Learned about setting the state on a component.

### 1/20
1. Finished the React Native tutorial.
	- Style merging
	- Consuming api's
	- Using npm packages
	- JSON server (cool little dev tool actually)
	- Expo env's
	- Ejecting the app (seems drastic)
2. Overall thoughts: Really enjoyed this class, and the React Native development experience. It certainly prove it's viability as a framework, but also exposed me to some of its fickleness. 

### 1/23
1. set up personal Azure account for experimentation/learning.

### 1/25
1. Looked for Pluralsight courses on Azure Blueprints but could not find any. 
2. Browsed other similar topics and found a course eventually called “Implement a containerization strategy”

### 1/26
1. Completed the first module of Azure: Implement a containerization strategy, and really enjoyed it
2. Learned the ins and outs of ACR (Azure Container Registry).
3. Feeling inspired to get on track for an Azure cert.
