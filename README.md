Days 15-30: Azure Blueprints

Goal: Build a complete template application using React Native and Azure Blueprints to be used as a foundation for making new applications.


## Daily Log

### 1/1

1. Read through the challenge description and came up with a loose plan:
		- Days 1-14: Learn about the basics of Reactive Native and build a tiny demo app.
		- Days: 15-30: Learn about Azure Blueprints and demo the React Native app using a blueprint.
2. Created a Pluralsight channel and added 3 React Native courses to start.

### 1/2

1. Completed modules 1 & 2 of "React Native: The Big Picture" course on Pluralsight.

### 1/3

1. Completed module 3 of "React Native: The Big Picture" course on Pluralsight. Thoughts so far:
	* Very basic, high level overview of Reactive Native.
	* Better suited for a sales person or product stakeholder evaluating frameworks.
	* Learned about the overall philosophy of the framework.
	* Love the mobile first, but also a web-app mindset.
	* Impressed with the promises, seems like an almost perfect choice for a modern application.
	* 2.5 Stars
2. Tools/links that may be useful:
	* React Native Debugger
	* Microsoft CodePush (App Center)
	* [Official Blog](https://reactnative.dev/blog)
	* [Docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
	* [Source Code](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

### 1/4
1. Completed the course "React Native: The Big Picture".
2. To Start:
	* npm install -g expo-cli
	* expo init MyNewProject
	* cd MyNewProject npm start
3. Alternative: [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)

### 1/5
1. Installed node/npm
2. Installed expo
3. Initialized a brand new React Native app using ignite and explored the template!

### 1/6
1. Started course "React Native: Getting Started"
2. Used the app I spun up earlier to compare with the basic app shown in the course and compared the simple/advanced styles.
3. Started gutting the template into something truly basic.
